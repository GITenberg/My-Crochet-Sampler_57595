<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The following pages contain a selection of patterns
adapted to almost every purpose to which the art of
Crochet is applicable,—whether as an useful or a
decorative species of work. Many of the designs
have been expressly composed for this little treatise;
others have been selected, as being very effective,
from the chapter on Crochet in “<span class="smcap">The Hand-Book
Of Needlework</span>;” but the designs that have been
taken from the latter have been re-engraved.</p>

<p>In the directions for working the several designs,
the plan pursued by the writer (and apparently with
success) in her books on Knitting, has been adopted.
She has aimed at simplicity, and the use of as few
words as possible, consistent with a clear explanation
of the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The reception given to “<span class="smcap">My Knitting Book</span>,” as
a treatise, separate from other descriptions of Decorative
Needlework, led her to suppose that a distinct
work on the sister art of Crochet might be equally
acceptable; and the publication of “<span class="smcap">Das neue
Hakelbuch Von Miss Lambert</span>,”—a literal translation
of the present volume, with its engravings,
proves that it has excited some attention, even in
Germany, a country which has laid claim to the invention
of the art.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Crochet,—a species of knitting
originally practised by the peasants
in Scotland, with a small hooked
needle called a shepherd’s hook,—aided
by taste and fashion, has, within
the last seven years, obtained the preference
over all other ornamental works
of a similar nature. It derives its present
name from the French; the instrument
with which it is worked being by them, from
its crooked shape, termed “crochet.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
art has attained its highest degree of perfection
in England, whence it has been transplanted
to France and Germany, and both these countries,
although unjustifiably, have claimed the
invention. Crochet has been applied, with
considerable success, to the production of numerous
useful and decorative articles, such as
shawls, table-covers, couvre-pieds, pillows, ottomans,
chairs, rugs, slippers, bags, cabats,
purses, caps, waistcoats, and the like. Silk,
wool, cotton, chenille, and gold, are all suitable
materials for this description of work, but the
purpose for which it is intended must necessarily
determine their choice.</p>

<p>Crochet has the recommendation of being a
less intricate method of working than knitting,
and therefore claims a more extensive cultivation
than perhaps it has hitherto met with. It
is particularly adapted for making articles for
charitable purposes; hence, the instruction of
children in <i>blind</i> schools, in this easy and useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
art, is well worthy the attention of philanthropists.
Waistcoats, shawls, knee-caps,
sleeves, comforters, mittens, gloves, etc., may
be made, without difficulty, in crochet. It has
not, however, been deemed necessary in the
following pages to give directions for any of
these simple articles, as, when the crochet
stitch is acquired, the modes of working such,
and a variety of others, in daily use, will readily
present themselves. As an example of the
double appropriation, which almost all the following
directions admit of, we may instance
the bottom of a bag;—this, if commenced with
a chain of about fifty stitches (not joining the
ends), and worked in coarse wool, with a large
needle, in rows backwards and forwards, gradually
increasing with a seam stitch, will form
a warm and comfortable round cape. A paper
pattern, the size of any desired object, can
easily be cut,—and the making a stitch at
the commencement, or the decreasing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
middle, or the end of a row, and <i>vice versâ</i>,
render this work subservient to almost any
form.</p>

<p>For large pieces of work, when wool is employed,
that kind denominated fleecy, either
English or German, is generally to be preferred.
This material, of a six-thread size, with an
ivory needle, offers the easiest kind of work
with which we are acquainted. It may be
readily learned, and has, therefore, been much
practised, both by invalids, and by persons
whose sight either needs relief, or has become
impaired. All striped patterns, if desired, may
be worked in narrow breadths, and joined in
the dividing lines; so that a table cover may
be made in four or six lengths, and afterwards
sewn together with wool, without the least detriment
to its appearance. Crochet may be
executed with coarse and fine chenille, for pillows,
bags, caps, and waistcoats; with crochet
silk, for caps, slippers, and bags; with coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
netting silk, it forms strong purses, bags, and
slippers; and the most delicate work may be
done with the finer silks. Gold and silver
cord, and passing, may be intermixed with the
chenilles and silks, or employed separately;
and gold and steel beads, first strung on the
silk, may be worked in various patterns, so as
to produce the most rich and beautiful effect.</p>

<p>Crochet may be divided into plain single
crochet, plain double crochet, plain stitch open
crochet, and open crochet with one, two, three,
or more stitches. These varieties will be described,
as they occur, in the following directions
for working.</p>

<p>The mode of working the crochet stitch,
although in itself most simple, is difficult to
describe in writing; but, with the aid of the
annexed engraving, which shows the position
of the hands, and the manner in which the
needle and the work should be held, we will
endeavour to explain the elementary process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/crochet2.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Illustration of hands crocheting" />
</div>

<p>Having wound a skein of wool, make a loop
at one end; through this loop draw another
loop, through this second loop another, and so
on, moderately tightening each, as it is drawn
through, until a <i>chain</i> of sufficient length be
made to serve as the <i>foundation</i> for the article
intended to be worked. Pass the needle
through the last loop of this foundation, and
catching the wool, draw it through, repeating
the same at every successive loop; then, return

and easiest lesson. The work will be the same
on both sides, producing, by turns, one raised
and one sunken row.</p>

of loops drawn one through the other.</p>

<p><i>Plain single crochet</i>,—where one loop only
is made on the needle, and drawn through
each stitch. It is lighter and thinner than
double crochet.</p>

<p><i>Plain double crochet</i>,—where two loops
are kept on the needle, and the wool drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
through both before the stitch is finished. This
is the crochet stitch generally practised, and
that used for working table-covers, etc.</p>

<p><i>Double stitch crochet</i>,—in this, both meshes
of the chain are taken. It is principally employed
for the soles of shoes, and where extra
thickness is required, but it is not suitable for
working patterns.</p>

<p><i>Plain stitch elastic crochet</i>,—is worked alternately
in rows backwards and forwards, from
right to left and from left to right, always taking
the under mesh of the chain.</p>

<p><i>Plain stitch open crochet</i>,—is composed of
chains, of five stitches each in length, forming
loops, each fifth stitch being crocheted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
centre stitch of the corresponding loop in the
preceding row, as shown in the engraving. It
is mostly used for purses.</p>

<p><i>Open crochet</i>—is worked (as nearly as can
be described) as follows:—make a chain of the
length required; work one plain stitch at the
beginning. Bring the silk round the needle,
and pass the needle through the first loop of
the chain; through this bring the silk, which
makes three stitches on the needle; draw the
silk through the first two stitches, which leaves
two on the needle; then draw the silk through
these two, which leaves one on the needle;
through this one, make one plain stitch. Put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the silk over the needle, and bring it through
the third loop of the chain; the three stitches,
as before, will now be found on the needle;
draw the silk through the first two, which leaves
two on the needle; draw the silk through these
two, which finishes the stitch, and leaves one
upon the needle as before. The plain stitch
that is then made between the two double
stitches, allows for the stitch which was passed
in the chain, and leaves an open space. It is
suitable for purses, bags, etc.</p>

<h3 id="heading5">DOUBLE OPEN CROCHET.</h3>

<p><i>Double open crochet</i>,—similar to the open
crochet stitch, but varied by making the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
long stitches together; this is done by omitting
the single stitch, and passing the needle
through the next loop of the chain, instead of
missing one stitch; thus producing two stitches
together, and then an open space. It is suitable
for bags, purses, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 id="heading6">TREBLE OPEN CROCHET.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="300" height="140" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 4.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Treble open crochet</i>,—also similar to the preceding,
but varied by making three stitches
successively, without making any plain stitch,
which produces alternate squares of open space
and stitches. <i>Beads</i> may be introduced on it
with very good effect in the following manner:—let
the beads be threaded on the silk, and
pass one on the middle stitch of the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
double stitches, giving a bead in the centre of
each square. This stitch makes a very pretty
purse.</p>

<p><i>To make a stitch</i>,—at the commencement
and end of a row, is to make one stitch of a
chain before the first stitch, and after the last,
which in the next row are to be crocheted.</p>

<p><i>A dividing, or seam stitch</i>,—called also a
<i>raised</i> stitch, is made by putting the needle
through both meshes of the chain, and working
two stitches in the same hole. These stitches
must always be made exactly over each other.
In crocheting circles they form a kind of star
pattern, and serve the purpose of increasing
stitches. They should not be employed when
working with <i>chenille</i>.</p>

<p><i>To increase a stitch</i>,—to make two stitches
in the same loop.</p>

<p><i>To decrease</i>,—to take two stitches together,
or to miss one stitch. Decreasing is always
done in the same ratio as increasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>True or perfect stitch</i>,—when working in
different colours, the keeping the stitches directly
over each other, without any appearance
of the half-stitch. This requires care, but it
greatly adds to the beauty of the work, and
makes the pattern more distinct.</p>

<p><i>To fasten off</i>,—to draw the wool through
the last stitch.</p>

<p><i>To fasten on</i>,—lay the ends of the wool
contrariwise, and crochet a few stitches with
both, or work in the second wool, and run the
end in with a needle at the back of the work.</p>

<p><i>To run the ends</i>,—to pass them down a
few stitches with a needle. This is the neatest
and strongest plan; but they may be tied and
cut off.</p>

<p><i>A dividing line</i>,—generally formed of two
stitches alternately up and down, into the
ground of the stripes on either side.</p>

<p><i>N. B. The engravings of the patterns are
placed in the book as they are intended to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
worked; that is, by commencing at the lower
part, on the right hand side.</i></p>

<h3 id="heading7">Hints on Crochet.</h3>

<p>A steel crochet needle is generally advisable;—with
expert workers, it makes the most even
stitches, but it is easier to work with an ivory
needle.</p>

<p>The second-sized netting silk is prettiest for
purses.</p>

<p>The coarsest, or crochet silk, is best adapted
for bags, with steel or gold beads.</p>

<p>Where many colours are required in a pattern,
and the same do not very frequently
occur, it is advisable to introduce them in
short lengths, instead of carrying on each
thread. This should always be attended to
when working with chenille.</p>

<p>When beads are used, they should be strung
on the silk with a needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>When beads are introduced, the wrong side
of the work becomes the right. It is possible
to crochet with the beads on the right side,
but they never lay so firmly, nor indeed is it
the proper way of using them.</p>

<p>The average number of stitches for the
length of a purse, in fine silk, is one hundred
and sixty. In coarse silk,—one hundred and
ten.</p>

<p>From ninety to one hundred stitches form
the circle of a purse in fine silk.</p>

<p>One hundred and thirty stitches may be
taken for the round of a bag, in crochet silk.</p>

<p>A table-cover, in six-thread fleecy, is generally
computed at about four hundred stitches
in length.</p>

<p>Borders of flowers, and very intricate patterns,
may be worked in crochet, but it would
be impossible to convey a complete idea of these
even to the most experienced worker, without
greatly exceeding the limits of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
work. The expert needle-woman will soon perceive
the best method of copying any pattern of
this description she may desire.</p>

<p>The terms <i>chiné</i> and <i>ombré</i>, are frequently
applied to the materials employed in crochet
and knitting. Wool and silk are <i>chiné</i>, when
two, three, or more <i>different</i> colours are introduced,
at intervals, on one thread, in the
process of dying;—they are <i>ombré</i>, when <i>one</i>
colour only is similarly employed, but which
gradually runs from the lightest to the darkest
shade.</p>

<p>N. B. In the directions for working the different
patterns in crochet, it must be borne in
mind, that unless any other stitch be mentioned,
the plain, or <i>double crochet stitch</i>, is
always to be employed.</p>

<h3 id="heading8">A Sofa Pillow, or Table Cover.</h3>

<p>This is merely given as the first and <i>easiest</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pattern in crochet, for the purpose of teaching
the stitch.</p>

<p>A good-sized ivory or steel crochet needle,
with six-thread fleecy, will be required. Instead
of working the rows backwards and forwards,
as before described, begin each row
separately at the same end. When the last
stitch of each row is finished, draw the wool
through, and cut it off, leaving an end of two
or three inches. It is impossible to determine
the exact number of stitches,—that must depend
on the article, and its required size; but
with this description of wool, half a yard in
length will generally be found to number about
sixty-five stitches, and a calculation may accordingly
be made.</p>

<p><i>First stripe</i>—one row black; one row white;
one row black.</p>

<p><i>Second stripe</i>—one row dark scarlet; one
bright scarlet; one light scarlet;—reverse the
same, to form a shaded stripe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third stripe</i>—the same as the first.</p>

<p><i>Fourth stripe</i>—the same as the second, but
in shades of blue.</p>

<p>These stripes are to be repeated alternately.</p>

<h3 id="heading9">Another very easy Pattern.</h3>

<p>The ground of this pattern is plain. The
cheques are composed of <i>chiné</i> wool, the first
row differing in colour from that of the second.
The dividing line is in plain colours.</p>

<p>This pattern may be worked in stripes of
different colours, varying the colour of the
cheques agreeably to that of the ground. It
is adapted for a pillow, or a variety of other
articles, according to the material employed.</p>

</div>

<p>Zephyr, or double German wool.</p>

<p>This pattern may be worked according to
the two following methods. The first is the
easiest, as one thread of wool only is required
to be carried on to form the pattern.</p>

<p>Commence with a chain and one row of
black. <i>Second row</i>—scarlet. <i>Third row</i>—straw
colour.</p>

<p>Crochet a stripe, consisting of seven rows of
imperial blue, with the pattern in <i>chiné</i> wool—black,
white, and scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Repeat the three plain rows, as before, reversed,—straw
colour, scarlet, and black.</p>

<p>Crochet another stripe with drab, with the
pattern in <i>chiné</i> wool—blue, black, and white.</p>

<p>Commence again as at first.</p>

<p>The second method of working this pattern
is as follows,—having the plain rows, and the
ground of the two stripes as before. Crochet
the figure of the blue stripe,—</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—three stitches black.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—three stitches claret; two
black.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—one stitch dark claret; one gold
colour; two dark scarlet; one black.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>—one stitch scarlet; two gold
colour; two scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row</i>—three stitches scarlet.</p>

<p>Crochet the figure on the drab stripe,—</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—three stitches claret.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—three stitches dark green; two
claret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—one stitch middle green; one
white; two middle green; one claret.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>—one stitch light green; two
white; two light green.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row</i>—three stitches light green.</p>

<p>The above pattern may be worked for a
bag, with the same colours, using silk instead
of wool, and commencing with a chain of about
one hundred and thirty stitches, with No. 2
Crochet Silk. It is a very easy bag to work,
and, if wished to be more elegant, gold may be
introduced. This pattern, also, with the same
sized silk, will make a very pretty crochet
slipper.</p>

<h3 id="heading11">A very Handsome and Easy Pattern.</h3>

<p>Commence with a chain and one row of
amber.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—two stitches of amber, and two
of black,—alternately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="550" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>Then crochet one plain row of black, which
forms the ground of the first stripe. The pine
pattern on this stripe occupies five rows in
height; the <i>first row</i>—blue; the <i>second</i>—scarlet;
the <i>third</i>—green; the <i>fourth</i>—yellow; the
<i>fifth</i>—white. One plain row of black; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one row—two stitches of black, and two of
amber,—alternately;—followed by one plain
row of amber, complete the first stripe.</p>

<p>The ground of the second stripe is scarlet;
the dividing lines,—both at top and bottom,—imperial
blue, the inner row of each being
composed of two stitches, alternately blue and
scarlet. The pattern occupies seven rows in
height; the <i>first row</i>—green; the <i>second</i>—black;
the <i>third</i>—blue; the <i>fourth</i>—amber;
the <i>fifth</i>—green; the <i>sixth</i>—stone colour; the
<i>seventh</i>—white.</p>

<p>The third stripe is imperial blue; the dividing
lines—amber; the pattern,—<i>first row</i>—black;
<i>second</i>—scarlet; <i>third</i>—white; <i>fourth</i>—green;
<i>fifth</i>—drab.</p>

<p>The fourth stripe is white; the dividing
lines—scarlet; the pattern,—<i>first row</i>—green;
<i>second</i>—black; <i>third</i>—blue; <i>fourth</i>—scarlet;
<i>fifth</i>—green: <i>sixth</i>—lilac; <i>seventh</i>—light
green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Repeat from the first stripe.</p>

<p>This pattern, worked with six-thread fleecy,
will be found very easy and effective for a
table cover; using a steel or ivory crochet
needle, according to the fancy of the
worker.</p>

<p>The same pattern, with the colours as above
described for the first and second stripes, with
No. 1 Crochet Silk, will make an extremely
elegant bag. This should be commenced with
a chain of about two hundred and sixteen
stitches, united at the two ends, whether for
a round, or square bag. Gold thread may be
substituted in the dividing lines, working only
one plain row, instead of two, as in the engraving.
Five of the narrow, and four of the
wide stripes, will form a bag of an ordinary
size.</p>

<p>This pattern may be worked beautifully
with chenille, or with chenille and gold, for a
variety of purposes.</p>

<p>This completes the pattern, which consists
of the same sprig repeated in different colours,
on three different coloured grounds. It will be
perceived that the sprigs run in a diagonal
direction; and the commencement of the first
two rows of the fourth stripe, on referring to
the corresponding part of the previous stripe,
will show where the next sprig is to be begun.</p>

<p>If worked for a bag, or sac de voyage, the
pattern should be commenced from the bottom,
thus forming a border at the lower part; but if
a pillow, table cover, or couvre-pied, is intended
to be made,—first crochet two plain rows, and
then commence the pattern as at the <i>sixteenth
row</i>.</p>

<p>For working the larger articles in the above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

smaller—German wool; and for the more
elegant—chenille and gold, or silk and gold.</p>

<p>The chain and first row black. The next
row alternate stitches of black and chiné wool
(say blue). The ground of the first stripe is

<h3 id="heading20">Raised Crochet.</h3>

<p>Raised, or ribbed crochet is worked in rows
from right to left, according
to the ordinary method;
but the side of the
work is reversed at every
alternate row, as in plain
crochet (see <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a>),
hence it becomes the
same as that description
of work, with this exception,
that the back,
or under stitch, is always
to be taken; it has therefore
a ribbed or raised
appearance, and is rendered
thicker and closer,
and of a more elastic
texture.</p>

<p>The annexed design
is well adapted for working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
in raised crochet. The colour, forming the
pattern, should only be introduced when necessary,
and should not be carried on through the
ground, as in plain double crochet; therefore,
the same thread must be taken up and dropt,
as the form of the pattern may require—a
process by no means difficult. When necessary,
however, the idle wool should be carried
through the stitches of that in use, and not left
loose at the back.</p>

<p>The pattern here given is intended to be
worked in stripes; these are afterwards to be
sewn together. It is very handsome for quilts,
couvre-pieds, &amp;c. The colours may be varied,
thus—first stripe, white, with the pattern in
scarlet; the second, scarlet, with the pattern
in white. Shaded wools may be used for the
pattern on a plain ground.</p>

carriage wrapper, d’oyley, and a variety of other
purposes, where a border on each side may be
required. It may be worked either in plain
double crochet, or in raised crochet. A different
material, together with a different sized
needle, are the only requisites to adapt it to
any of the above purposes. Thus,—</p>

<p>For a sofa pillow, eight-thread zephyr fleecy;
for a tidy, three-thread fleecy; for a window
mat, eight-thread common fleecy; for a flower
mat, German or English wool; for a cradle
quilt, eight-thread zephyr fleecy; for a bed
quilt, six-thread fleecy; for a d’oyley, rather
fine knitting cotton. The size of the article,
however, must in the first instance be determined,
and the number of stitches counted, so
as to bring in the pattern as suited to that size.
The simplest colouring will be the most effective,—a
plain ground, with the pattern in any
bright colour. Designs of this description,
which require calculation and constant counting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
may be adopted as amusing, but not as
very easy work.</p>

<h3 id="heading23">A Diagonal-Striped Bag, with Star-Shaped

<p>Make a chain of fourteen stitches, in claret
crochet silk; join both ends together, and crochet
one plain row all round. In the next row
(in order to keep the circle flat), every other
stitch is to be made a seam or dividing stitch,
which is done by putting the needle under both
loops instead of one, and making two stitches,
in the same place, every other stitch being a
plain stitch. In the next row, work the seam-stitch
in the same place, leaving two plain
stitches between each, instead of one. Repeat
this circle sixteen times, always observing to
keep the seam stitch in the same place, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
number of plain stitches gradually increasing,
when a flat surface of about four inches in diameter
will be produced, intersected with seven
raised stripes. A vandyke border in claret and
green may now be made as follows.</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—five stitches claret; one green.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—three stitches claret; three
green.</p>

<p>Make a chain of fourteen stitches, join both
ends together with the crochet, and crochet
one plain row all round. In the next row,
every other stitch is to be made a seam or dividing
stitch, which is done by putting the
needle under both loops, instead of under one,
and making two stitches in the same place:
every other stitch being a plain stitch, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
is to be a bead. In the next row, work the
seam stitch exactly over the last, which will
leave two plain stitches between, instead of
one; this is to be repeated until eight circles
are formed, every plain stitch having a bead
on it. Crochet eight rows more, leaving the
seam-stitch in the same place, but diminish the
number of beads, by leaving out one bead in
each division on each successive circle, so that
the last row will have but one bead in each division.
Then, crochet four plain rows, keeping
the seam-stitch in the same place as before,
then one plain row all round, without a seam-stitch,
which forms the bottom of the bag.</p>

claret; unite the ends, and crochet one plain
row,—increasing on every stitch. Join on the
black silk, and work one stitch of black, and
two of claret,—alternately,—increasing with
the black stitch. There should now be twenty-seven
stitches. Work another row the same,
but without increasing. In the next row, (<i>the
third</i>, with two colours)—two stitches black,
two claret,—alternately—increasing with the
black stitches. The two stitches of claret are
to be repeated over each other (so as to form a
star) in each of the nine following rows.</p>

one stitch on every two stitches of

<p>The above pattern is now to be worked.—Commence
with the gold, to form a half row of
diamonds, by crocheting one plain row. In the
next row,—three stitches gold, one black,—alternately;—in
the next row,—one stitch gold,
three black,—alternately. The next row is
black,—forming the centre row, of the first
perfect row of diamonds.</p>

<p>The next row of diamonds,—formed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

preceding,—one stitch écru; three black; in
the next row,—three stitches écru; one black.</p>

<p>This finishes the first complete row of diamonds
in black. The next row is plain écru,—forming
the centre row of the second perfect

is to be a middle shade of écru; the fourth—the
lightest shade of écru.</p>

from the first blue stitch.</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth and eighteenth rows</i>—claret,—without

<p><i>Nineteenth row</i>—claret,—increasing one
stitch on every thirty-third. This row should
contain one hundred and thirty-six stitches,
when the bag will have acquired its full size,
and the increasing be finished.</p>

<p>The next three rows are worked in four
stitches of gold, and four of claret,—alternately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Then, four plain rows, viz.—one of gold; one
of black; one of white; and one of gold;—followed
by one row of blue, and one row of
white, in double open crochet; then, one row
of gold, one row of black, and one row of gold,
in plain crochet. Repeat the two rows of
double open crochet,—the first in blue, the
second in claret;—also the one row of gold;
the one row of black; and the one row of gold.
Commence again with the rows of blue and
white, in double open crochet.</p>

<p>There should be four divisions of double open
crochet, the bag being finished with the black
and gold stripe.</p>

<h3 id="heading29">An open Crochet Bag in Chenille.</h3>

<p>Make a chain of six loops, in fine blue chenille,
and unite both ends. Crochet in rows,—to
form a round (increasing a sufficient
number of stitches in each row to keep the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
flat), until fourteen rows are finished. This
forms the bottom of the bag.</p>

<p>Commence a <i>vandyke</i> pattern, by making
one stitch of gold to every fifth of the coloured
ground, in the first row. In the next row
three stitches of gold, and three of the ground;
in the next, five of the gold, and one of the
ground. The two next rows are to be plain—the
first of gold, the second of black.</p>

<p>Work two rows of open crochet,—the one in
scarlet, the other in blue.</p>

<p>The two rows of black, with one row of gold
between, are then to be worked in plain crochet;
followed by two rows of open crochet,—the
first white, the second blue. Repeat the
two rows of black, with the gold between, and
the two rows of open crochet,—alternately, to
complete the bag.</p>

<p>About sixteen skeins of chenille, and
twenty-four yards of gold cord, will be required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading30">A Greek Cap in Crochet Silk.</h3>

<p>Commence at the top with a chain of fourteen
stitches, unite the ends, and crochet one
plain row. In the next row, make a raised or
dividing line on every other stitch, as for the
bottoms of bags. The increasing must be continued
until the diameter of the circle is about
six inches and a half. Work round this, in
plain rows, until the cap be sufficiently deep;
occasional increasing stitches may be made, if
it be not large enough.</p>

<p>The cap should be finished with a double
gold braid,—meeting the points of the increasing
lines: a gold band round the bottom,
and a handsome tassel at the top may be added;
or in the place of these, silk trimmings may be
substituted. It requires to be very neatly made
up in the inside.</p>

<h3 id="heading31">A Greek Cap in coarse Chenille.</h3>

<p>Commence at the top with a chain of six or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
eight stitches; unite the ends, and work in
rows round and round, (increasing a sufficient
number of stitches in each row to keep the work
flat,) until it be about eight inches in diameter.
The sides may be worked in open crochet, introducing
a few plain lines of black and gold
between each two rows of the open crochet.</p>

<p>The best colours for a cap in chenille are
black and gold;—dark blue, black, and gold;—and
claret, black, and gold.</p>

<h3 id="heading32">An Essuie-Plume.</h3>

<p>Commence with a chain of about six stitches
in plain green netting silk; crochet both ends
together; work three plain rows of green, and
then one row of alternate stitches of dark scarlet
and green.</p>

<p>The scarlet silk will now form the ground, on
which the star pattern of green is to be worked.
Crochet a row with two stitches of green, and
two of scarlet, alternately; in the next row,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
two of scarlet and three of green. Crochet, in
a similar manner, one row after another, increasing
on each row one stitch in the green
pattern, every time that colour is repeated,
until it counts seven stitches in each division;
taking care to keep the two scarlet stitches of
the ground exactly over each other.</p>

<p>The pattern is now to be decreased, by
working four stitches of scarlet and five of
green; in the next row,—seven of scarlet and
three of green; and in the next,—ten of scarlet
and one of green;—increasing one stitch in
each division of the ground.</p>

<p>Work two plain rows of scarlet, increasing a
sufficient number of stitches to keep the work
flat, and finish with a kind of fringe, formed by
two rows of open crochet in green.</p>

<h3 id="heading33">A Neck Chain.</h3>

<p>The chain is made by commencing with five
plain stitches, then putting the needle through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the back of the second stitch, and making one
plain stitch. It will be found, by twisting the
chain after every stitch, that one stitch appears
to go across,—this is the stitch that is always
to be taken and crocheted.</p>

<h3 id="heading34">A Crochet Slipper.</h3>

<p>The light-coloured stripes composing this
slipper, are alternately buff and white: the
dark stripe between each is a full blue. Each
stripe is separated by a dividing line of black.
The colours of the pattern on each stripe, are
as follow:—</p>

<p>Commence at the toe with the blue stripe,—the
colours of the pattern being claret, gold
colour, and scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>second stripe</i> is buff,—the colours of the
pattern being dark blue, lilac, scarlet, and
green.</p>

<p>Repeat the blue stripe.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth stripe</i> is white,—the colours of
the pattern being violet, lilac, green, and
scarlet.</p>

<p>This slipper may be worked in crochet silk,
or German wool. The number of stripes must
depend on the required size of the slipper.</p>

<h3 id="heading35">Another Crochet Slipper.</h3>

</div>

<p>The above pattern is intended for a slipper,
in <i>German wool</i>, or crochet silk, in stripes,
across the front, continued in the same direction
round the back. The colours of the different
stripes,—commencing at the toe, are as follow:—</p>

<p><i>First stripe</i>—gold colour; with the pattern
composed of black, green, white, bright scarlet,
and black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Second stripe</i>—blue; the pattern in scarlet,
black, gold colour, white, and claret.</p>

<p><i>Third stripe</i>—(the centre of the engraving)
scarlet; this stripe is wider than any other on
the slipper. The pattern on it is composed of
light green, dark green, black, light blue, and
gold colour, dark blue and claret, black, gold
colour and lilac, white and dark lilac, light
green, and dark green.</p>

<p><i>Fourth stripe</i>—white; the pattern in blue,
yellow, lilac, green, and scarlet.</p>

<p>The narrow stripes are repeated round the
back of the slipper; they are gold colour, blue,
scarlet, white, and green.</p>

<p>For a moderate-sized gentleman’s slipper in
crochet silk, the toe might be commenced with
twenty-four stitches, and increased in the succeeding
rows, until the width across the instep
were eighty stitches,—but, as some persons
work so much tighter than others, a positive
number cannot be given. The silk also may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
vary in size, as well as the dimensions required
for a slipper. The increasing is made by the
addition of a stitch on each side of the work.</p>

<p>The stripes in the front of the slipper are
gold colour, blue, scarlet, and white; the latter
crosses the instep. Count the number of stitches
on the white stripe, and, with the gold colour
commence a stripe one third of its length on
one side, to form the back. Continue these
stripes, until the back be sufficiently long to be
sewn to the front on the other side. It is advisable,
before commencing a slipper, to cut a
paper pattern of the desired size and shape.</p>

<p>The above form <i>chaussons</i> to wear over the
shoes, the sole being formed of coarse crochet
in black; or they may be made up in the usual
way for slippers, either for ladies or gentlemen.
In crochet silk they are extremely warm and
durable.—The ends of the wool or silk, are
to be threaded with a needle, and run into the
work on the inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading36">A Purse.</h3>

<p>Plain crochet-purses are exceedingly strong,
and may be made very prettily with a moderate
sized netting silk. Those, worked in rows the
length of the purse, are the most easily made.</p>

<p>Make a chain in scarlet netting silk of one
hundred and forty stitches, on which crochet
three plain rows with the same colour. Then,
five plain rows in shades of green, or stone
colour. These two stripes are to be repeated
until the purse is of a sufficient width. When
completed, it is to be neatly sewn up, or joined
by crocheting the two sides together. The
ends are then to be drawn up, and the purse
trimmed.</p>

<h3 id="heading37">A Plain Purse with one Square and one
Round End.</h3>

<p>Commence with a chain of fourteen stitches,
and joining both ends together, crochet one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
plain row all round. In the next row, every
alternate stitch is to be made a dividing or
seam-stitch; this is done by passing the needle
under both the corresponding loops in the first
row, and making two stitches in the same place.
This dividing stitch is to be repeated in the
same place on each row, until ten rows are
worked; when a sufficient number of plain
rows are to be crocheted according to the length
of the purse, until the side opening commences.</p>

<p>The opening of the purse is made by crocheting
plain rows, alternately, from right to left,
and from left to right. When a sufficient number
of these are done:—</p>

<p>The plain rows are again to be worked, to
correspond with the former part; but, instead
of the round end, it is to be left square, and
sewn up, with a tassel at either corner.</p>

<h3 id="heading38">A Plain-stitch Open Crochet Purse.</h3>

<p>Make a chain of one hundred and sixty, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
one hundred and seventy stitches; to the last
stitch of this, crochet a short chain of five
stitches, the last of which is again to be crocheted
to the fifth stitch of <i>the chain</i>; repeat this
on the whole length of the foundation; and
return along the row in the same way, by attaching
every fifth stitch to the centre stitch of
each loop of the last row. The whole of the
purse is to be continued in the same manner,
but it may be varied, according to taste, by
using two or more colours. When the purse is
worked to the size desired, cut a piece of stiff
cardboard, and sew the purse firmly to it,—the
wrong side outwards; then, damp it with
water, and allow it to remain until dry. This
process will stretch the purse, tighten the
stitches, and bring them all into their proper
places. Then, having sewn or crocheted up
the sides, draw up the ends and put on the
trimmings.—This purse should only be made
with fine silk.</p>

one of the circular figures, in the centre of
each stripe; and also, to reverse the direction
of the pattern at the opposite end of the purse.</p>

<p>Ponceau, blue, or green, may be substituted
for the violet silk.</p>

<p>This pattern may also be effectively worked
in any two decided colours, either with zephyr,
or six-thread fleecy, for sofa pillows, tidies, etc.</p>

<h3 id="heading40">A Short Purse.</h3>

<p>Commence at the bottom with a chain of
fourteen stitches; unite both ends, and work
round and round, increasing by means of dividing
lines, until a flat circle of about two
inches in diameter be formed. On this, work
plain rows until the purse be about three inches
in length. It must then be exactly divided,
and each side worked backwards and forwards,
for about eight rows, or whatever is sufficient
for the depth of the snap.</p>

<p>The same pattern may also be worked in gold
or steel beads, but it will then be advisable to
omit the pattern in the centre of the purse.
An additional colour may be introduced, with
very good effect, on the ground between the

<p>Make a chain of one hundred and seventy
stitches, in reel silk. To the commencement
of this chain, crochet another short chain (as
in plain stitch open crochet), of three stitches,
the third stitch of which pass through the
fourth stitch of <i>the chain</i>, and work three plain
stitches. Crochet another chain of three
stitches, and pass the last stitch, as before,
through the fourth stitch of <i>the chain</i>. This
is to be repeated to the end of the row.</p>

<p>All the succeeding rows are the same, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that the plain stitches of the next row are
always one stitch in advance of the preceding.</p>

<p>Spiral crochet may be varied by working
five, or seven stitches, instead of three, as

may thus be made, by the introduction of gold,
and using the silk in shades.</p>

</div>

<p>Four-thread fleecy with a steel needle.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give the exact number of
stitches for the commencement of a chancelière,
as each row varies; it is advisable, therefore,
to cut the shape in stiff paper, as a pattern,—first
of the top, and then of the border. In
those parts where it is requisite to increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the width of the work, it should be done by
making an extra stitch on each side. The
stitches of the border are to be worked in a
contrary direction to those of the top, as shown
in the preceding engraving.—The following
pattern will be found suitable for a chancelière.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus33.jpg" width="500" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 33.</p>
</div>

<p>Commence at the toe, by working two plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rows of ground in scarlet, and crochet the
centre stripe of the annexed pattern in rich
green, on the same coloured ground.</p>

<p>The ground of the next stripe is black, on
which the pattern is to be worked in three
shades of gold colour.</p>

<p>Work a plain row of middle blue, which also
forms the ground of the small chain pattern,
with the exception of the centre row, which is
claret. The chain is in white.</p>

<p>Work a plain row of claret, and then repeat
the second stripe as before, with the colours reversed.</p>

<p>The above colours, if well chosen, are exceedingly
pretty, but they may be varied according
to fancy.</p>

<p>The slipper pattern No. 23, and also the
Turkish pattern No. 12, are equally adapted
for a chancelière.</p>

<p>The chancelière should be made up on a
very firm foundation, and stuffed between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
lining and the work with wool: the inside
should be made separate, and knitted in the
<i>brioche</i> stitch, with six or eight thread fleecy.
The ermine ruff, or trimming, of worsted, may
easily be procured, but if it cannot readily be
so, a thick knitted fringe, three or four times
doubled, will be a good substitute. The bottom
is formed of leather or cloth.</p>

<h3 id="heading50">A Square Border Pattern.</h3>

<p>The annexed pattern is adapted for any
square requiring a border, such as a table
cover, mat, quilt, sofa cushion, couvre-pied,
etc. To render it easy, the centre may be
worked in the same colours as the border,
introducing any spot, sprig, or other small pattern,—the
same colours being carried through
the whole, or slipped at the back. If, however,
the plan of introducing the colour only
in the pattern be understood, it may here be
employed with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/illus34.jpg" width="550" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 34.</p>
</div>

<p>The ground of the pattern might be in a
self colour,—say white, with the pattern in
scarlet; or, the ground might be in five shades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of scarlet, the pattern being crocheted in emerald
green, blue, white, or black, according to
taste, or the purpose for which the work was
designed. The whole of the pattern might
also be worked in chiné or shaded wool.</p>

<p>The kind of wool to be used must be adapted
to the purpose for which the work is required;
thus,—for a quilt or couvre-pied, six-thread
fleecy—for a mat, eight thread common fleecy;—for
a table mat, German wool; for a baby’s
quilt, or a sofa pillow, eight thread zephyr
fleecy.</p>

<p>For the centre of the design, either the preceding
sprig pattern, or the patterns Nos. 20
or 39, may be taken. If the ground be worked
in shades, five shades of any colour, neither too
distinct, nor too dark, should be selected.</p>

raised crochet, as described at <a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>.</p>

<h3 id="heading57">A Brioche.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/brioche.jpg" width="300" height="185" alt="Illustration of a brioche" />
</div>

<p>A Brioche (so called from its resemblance
in shape to the well known French cake of
that name), may be as easily worked in crochet
as in knitting. It may also be divided into
stripes or compartments, gradually decreasing
in breadth towards the top or centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cushion, in the same manner as in the knitted
brioche. Various patterns may be introduced
in these stripes, but, when a very soft cushion
is desired, this is not advisable, as the extra
wool, then required to be carried through the
work, would render it of too firm a texture.</p>

<p>The following directions for working a
brioche in crochet will be found very simple,
and, at the same time, serve as a guide for
those of a more complicated nature.</p>

<p>Commence with a chain of seventy stitches
in eight-thread zephyr fleecy—black.</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—black.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—gold colour.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—black.</p>

<p>The above three rows are all of an equal
length. Then, crochet fifteen rows in any
pretty colour, omitting four stitches at the
end of the first, and of each successive row,
so that in the last of these fifteen rows there
will be only ten stitches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Repeat the row of black, taking in each of
the four stitches omitted at the ends of the
last fifteen rows, as also the four stitches at
the top of the last row of black. Crochet one
row of gold colour, and one row of black, as at
the commencement, when one compartment
of the brioche will be completed, forming a
conical stripe.</p>

<p>Repeat the fifteen rows, omitting the four
stitches at the end of each row, as before directed;
and continue as above until sixteen
similar compartments are worked; this will be
found sufficient for an ordinary-sized brioche.</p>

<p>The colours of the stripes may be varied,
thus,—blue, brown, scarlet, and stone colour,
in their order of succession, repeated four times,
will form a very pretty contrast,—the dividing
stripe between each being formed of two rows
of black, with a row of gold between them.
Either chiné or ombré wool may also be employed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>When finished, the brioche may be made up
either entirely soft, or with a stiff bottom of
mill-board, about six or eight inches in diameter,
covered with cloth or velvet. The top
should be drawn together, and fastened in the
centre, either with a tuft of soft wool, or with
a cord and tassels, as represented in the preceding
engraving. It should be stuffed with
down or fine combed wool.</p>

but, as the latter should form the outer edge at
the side of the bag, and cannot be worked without
a foundation, it will be necessary to begin
with the figured stripe in silk, and afterwards
to open the treble open crochet in gold on
either side of it.—Therefore,</p>

<p>Commence with a chain in dark green
netting silk.—The number of stitches must
depend on the size of the silk employed,
but a chain of about twelve inches in length
will be found sufficient for a bag of this
description. The bag should be worked in
one length.</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—dark green.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—two stitches of ponceau, and
two of dark green, alternately.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—ponceau.</p>

<p>In the fourth row the pattern commences
with two colours, the wave portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pattern being in dark green; with the bell in
a lighter shade of green; the ground, ponceau:
or, the pattern may be worked in chiné
greens.</p>

<p>Eight rows complete the pattern, when a
plain row of ponceau, a row of two alternate
stitches of ponceau and green, and a plain row
of green, finish the stripe.</p>

<p>Crochet two rows of treble open crochet in
gold; and commence again with the pattern in
silk.</p>

<p>This bag when completed is about six inches
square; it should be hemmed at the top, and
lined, and finished with strings and tassels.</p>

<p>The pattern No. 24, is also equally adapted
for a bag of this description; but in the centre
of the work the pattern should be reversed, in
order that when the two sides of the bag are
folded together the pattern may run in the
same direction, as in the manner described for
the bag at <a href="#Page_113">page 113</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading59">A similar Bag.</h3>

<p>A very easy but extremely elegant bag in
perpendicular stripes may be made by commencing
with—</p>

<p>Chain and <i>first row</i>—scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—gold.</p>

<p>Crochet eleven plain rows in scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth row</i>—gold.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth row</i>—scarlet.</p>

<p>On each side of the band thus made, crochet
two rows of treble open crochet in gold.</p>

<p>Four plain scarlet stripes, and five of the
open crochet, arranged as in the preceding
example, complete the bag.</p>

<h3 id="heading60">A Bag with Five Points.</h3>

<p>Commence with a chain of eight stitches:
having united the ends, make every other
stitch a treble increased stitch,—by crocheting
three stitches in one loop. Continue to increase
in a similar manner, until twenty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rows be worked, taking care that the increasing
stitches be kept exactly over each other; when
a point in the centre, and a point at the termination
of each line of dividing stitches, will be
formed. The remaining part of the bag is to be
worked in rounds, until it be of sufficient height.</p>

<p>The prettiest way of working this description
of bag, is with steel or gold beads.</p>

<p>The following pine pattern may be taken for
the centre of each division of points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The upper part of the bag may be semé,
with a pattern composed of beads, such as the
following.</p>

<p>The top may be finished with three plain
rows of crochet; or with any small border
pattern in beads, similar to those figured beneath:
but for this purpose there are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
others, in various parts of the book, equally
appropriate, and that may be selected according
to the taste of the worker.</p>

<h3 id="heading61">A Bag in Treble open Crochet.</h3>

<p>This bag should be worked in one long
piece, and afterwards folded together, so that
the rows range perpendicularly; in the same
manner as that described at <a href="#Page_123">page 123</a>.</p>

<p>Commence with a chain in ponceau.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>First row</i>—gold.</li>
<li><i>Second row</i>—deep blue.</li>
<li><i>Third row</i>—ponceau.</li>
<li><i>Fourth row</i>—deep blue.</li>

</ul>

<p class="noindent">treble open crochet.</p>

<p>Repeat from the first row, until the bag be
of a sufficient breadth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading62">Patterns in open Crochet.</h3>

<p>Open crochet, as also double and treble open
crochet, have already been fully described (see
<a href="#Page_16">page 16</a>). The two following patterns are,
amongst numerous others of a like description,
merely variations of a similar kind of work:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus47.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 47.</p>
</div>

<p>It is therefore unnecessary to enter into a detailed
description of these, as it would occupy
too great a space, and the engravings sufficiently
explain themselves. These patterns
are useful for a variety of purposes, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for working with cotton, for tidies, D’Oyleys,
etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption-no">No. 48.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="heading63">A Travelling Bolster.</h3>

<p>The two circular ends should be worked
first. Commence with a chain of six stitches,
in black four-thread fleecy: unite both ends,
and crochet all round, increasing on every
stitch for the <i>first row</i>.</p>

<p>The pattern is then to be worked in three
shades of scarlet, on a ground composed of three
shades of green; the darkest shade of the scarlet
being on the lightest shade of the green.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—one stitch dark scarlet; two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
light green.—Repeat.—This forms the commencement
of a star of six points.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—three stitches dark scarlet; two
light green.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>—five stitches middle scarlet;
two light green.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row</i>—five stitches middle scarlet; three
middle green.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Sixth row</i>—three stitches light scarlet; six
middle green.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Seventh row</i>—one stitch light scarlet; eight
dark green.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Eighth row</i>—dark green.</p>

<p>Two plain rows of black finish the end.</p>

<p>N. B. In every row, increasing stitches are
to be made in the green, as also on the plain
rows of black.</p>

<p>Having finished the two ends, make a chain
of about sixteen inches in length, in black;
and work the other part of the bolster as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><i>First row</i>—black.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—dark green.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—middle green.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>—light green.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row</i>—white.</p>

<p>Repeat the first four rows—reversed.</p>

<p><i>Tenth and Eleventh rows</i>—scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Twelfth row</i>—commence a pattern, by working
alternately six stitches of scarlet and four
of black.</p>

<p><i>Thirteenth row</i>—seven stitches scarlet (a);
four yellow; six scarlet.—Repeat from (a).</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth row</i>—six stitches scarlet; four
black.—Repeat.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth row</i>—seven stitches scarlet; (b) four
light green; six scarlet.—Repeat from (b).</p>

<p><i>Sixteenth and Seventeenth rows</i>—scarlet.</p>

<p>Commence again as at first row; and repeat,
until a piece be worked sufficiently long to go
easily round the ends.</p>

<p>The bolster should be made up by stuffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it with down or soft wool. A long crochet
band, worked similar to the green shaded
stripe, should be attached to either end, with a
small worsted tuft in the centre, by way of ornament.</p>

<p>Bags, worked in a similar manner to the
above, are frequently made; these, however,
are not required to be so long. They are
fastened at the opening with strings or buttons.
They may be made with eight-thread zephyr
fleecy.</p>

<h3 id="heading64">A Slipper in Raised Crochet.</h3>

<p>Raised, or ribbed crochet has already been
described at <a href="#Page_57">page 57</a>. To work a slipper,
commence with a chain of seven stitches, and
crochet forty-six rows backwards and forwards,
observing to make three stitches in one loop
in the centre stitch of each row. This will
make a sufficient increase in each succeeding
row to form the front of the slipper, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the same time cause the ribbed rows to run in
an uniform diagonal direction on either side.</p>

<p>Having thus completed the front of the shoe,
crochet, on the right-hand side, a row of twenty-six
stitches, and work a sufficient number of
rows (about ninety) to form the back. The
end of this band is then to be sewn to the
other side of the front.</p>

<p>The sole of the slipper may be made either
of leather, or of crochet in coarse wool; the
latter is most readily made by cutting the shape
in stiff paper, and then working it to the exact
size. The top of the slipper may be finished
with an ermine trimming of worsted.</p>

<h3 id="heading65">A Half Square Shawl.</h3>

<p>Commence with a chain of nine hundred
stitches in black eight-thread zephyr fleecy.</p>

<p><i>First row</i>—black.</p>

<p><i>Second and Third rows</i>—white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Crochet eleven rows, alternately with black,
and any pretty chiné wool.</p>

<p><i>Fourteenth and Fifteenth rows</i>—white.</p>

<p><i>Sixteenth and Seventeenth rows</i>—green.</p>

<p>Crochet eleven rows, alternately with scarlet,
and any bright chiné wool.</p>

<p><i>Twenty-ninth and Thirtieth rows</i>—green.</p>

<p><i>Thirty-first and Thirty-second rows</i>—black.</p>

<p>Crochet eleven rows, alternately with white,
and a chiné wool.</p>

<p><i>Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth rows</i>—black.</p>

<p><i>Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh rows</i>—red.</p>

<p>Crochet eleven rows, alternately with green,
and a chiné wool.</p>

<p><i>Fifty-ninth and Sixtieth rows</i>—scarlet.</p>

<p>Repeat from second row.</p>

<p>By omitting a stitch in the centre of each
row, the shawl will assume, whilst working, a
pointed form, similar to that of a half square,
at the same time that the rows of crochet will
run in a diagonal direction from either side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the centre. It may be trimmed with a black
fringe of about four inches deep sewn on the
two sides.</p>

<p>To form the striped pattern as above directed,
four chiné wools, of different colours,
should be employed.</p>

<h3 id="heading66">A Light Shawl.</h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus49.jpg" width="600" height="220" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 49.</p>
</div>

<p>This is worked with German wool, in open
crochet stitch, but without leaving a stitch between
each, as in the ordinary method.</p>

<p>Chain and <i>first row</i>—claret.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—two stitches claret, two blue,
alternately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—blue.</p>

<p>Crochet the above pattern in claret on the
blue ground.</p>

<p><i>Fifteenth row</i>—blue.</p>

<p><i>Sixteenth row</i>—two stitches claret, two blue,
alternately.</p>

<p><i>Seventeenth row</i>—claret.</p>

<p>Repeat from first row.—In the second stripe
of the pattern, deep gold colour should be used
in place of the blue, and black in place of the
claret wool; thus working, alternately, a stripe
in each of the two colours.</p>

<h3 id="heading67">Border for a Shawl.</h3>

<p>This will form a good pine pattern for the
border of a shawl, in German wool on a black
ground.</p>

<p>Commence with chain and <i>first row</i>—deep
gold colour.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—black.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Then crochet the annexed pine on a black
ground, in the following colours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus50.jpg" width="600" height="270" alt="" />
<p class="caption-no">No. 50.</p>
</div>

<p><i>First row</i>—imperial blue.</p>

<p><i>Second row</i>—lighter shade of blue.</p>

<p><i>Third row</i>—deep scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Fourth row</i>—bright scarlet.</p>

<p><i>Fifth row</i>—dark green.</p>

<p><i>Sixth row</i>—middle green.</p>

<p><i>Seventh row</i>—dark lilac.</p>

<p><i>Eighth row</i>—light lilac.</p>

<p><i>Ninth and Tenth rows</i>—two shades of stone
colour.</p>

<p><i>Eleventh and Twelfth rows</i>—two shades of
blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thirteenth and Fourteenth rows</i>—two shades
of scarlet.</p>

<p>Then, work one plain row of black, and one
plain row of gold colour.</p>

<p>To form a point, if it be intended for the
border of a half square shawl, omit a stitch in
the centre of each row;—this, if the size of
the shawl has been determined upon, previously
to commencing the work, may easily be done
without interfering with the pattern, as by calculating
the number of stitches required, a
greater space of the ground where the stitches
are to be omitted between the two centre pines
may be allowed. For a square shawl, the border,
if preferred, may be worked separately,
and afterwards sewn on.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
